        The team at Something Designed is packed full of professional miracle
        workers. Their artistic direction, creative input and thorough attention
        to detail is invaluable. We came to them with a half-baked idea, and
        they turned it into a fully baked creative concept!
        <br />
        The swiftness at which they work is only matched by their creative
        expertise. They are a privilege to work with and invest themselves in
        the processâ€”adding pearls of wisdom and thoughtful ideas all along the
        way. I would trust this team with my highest creative priorities. This
        is one badass group of women, who happen to be badass designers.

        Chip Herter, Director of Syncronization, BUTTER MUSIC AND SOUND.
