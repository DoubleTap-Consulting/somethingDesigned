          The team at Something Designed is packed full of professional miracle
          workers. Their artistic direction, creative input and thorough
          attention to detail is invaluable. We came to them with a half-baked
          idea, and they turned it into a fully baked creative concept!

        <p className="whoWeAreView-text">
          The swiftness at which they work is only matched by their creative
          expertise. They are a privilege to work with and invest themselves in
          the processâ€”adding pearls of wisdom and thoughtful ideas all along the
          way. I would trust this team with my highest creative priorities. This
          is one badass group of women, who happen to be badass designers.
