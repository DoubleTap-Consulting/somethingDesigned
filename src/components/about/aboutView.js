    <p>{`The team at Something Designed is packed full of professional miracle workers. Their artistic direction, creative input and thorough attention to detail is invaluable. We came to them with a half-baked idea, and they turned it into a fully baked creative concept! 

The swiftness at which they work is only matched by their creative expertise. They are a privilege to work with and invest themselves in the processâ€”adding pearls of wisdom and thoughtful ideas all along the way. I would trust this team with 
my highest creative priorities. This is one badass group of women, who happen to be badass designers.
